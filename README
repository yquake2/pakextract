                      ----------

pakextract is a small tool to extract the contents of 
a Quake II pak file into the current directory. Usage:
 
 ./pakextract [ -o output_directory ] /path/to/pakfile.pak

Only Quake II paks are supported. Other pak formats may
work but it's untested and unsupported.

            The Quake II Pak File Format
            ----------------------------

A Quake II pak file consists of 3 parts:
 - Header
 - Directory
 - Data

The header is written right after the start
of the file and consists of 3 parts in the
following order:
 - A 4 byte identification string "PACK" (in ASCII)
 - A 4 byte integer value defining the offset to the
   directory in bytes
 - A 4 byte iteger giving the length of the directory
   in bytes. Since every directory entry is 64 bytes 
   long this value modulo 64 must be 0: 
     (dir_length % 64) == 0;

The directory can be anywere in the file but most times
it's written to the end. In consists of datablocks, 
written one after the other without any space between
them. A directory entry is 64 bytes long has entries
in the following order:
 - A 56 byte file name (in ASCII)
 - A 4 byte value defining the position if the file
   as an offset in bytes to the start of the pak file.
 - A 4 byte integer giving the length of the file
   in bytes.
